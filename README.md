# No-Minecart-Sound
This resource pack is for people who have redstone mechanisms with minecarts, and who are tired of their sound.



Resourse pack for all versions, ignore the message "Made for a newer version of Minecraft".



In version, when you don't change anything, you don't hear how minecart drives, not when you're inside. Guide to change this:

If you need to hear sound only when you are inside minecart, just delete the file in this patch "ยง3NoMinecartSound.zip\assets\minecraft\sounds\minecart\inside.ogg".

If you don't need to hear sound when you are inside minecart, but need hear sound drive minecart without you, just delete the file in this patch "ยง3NoMinecartSound.zip\assets\minecraft\sounds\minecart\base.ogg".
